## Near Vision
Our initial focus in our product is to have a functioning website with a start screen. Our product will have a home button, about section, settings page,and game modes section.
The home button will allow the player to return to the inital screen they were presented after the start screen. The about page will describe the team, the reasoning behind 
the website's creation, and give an intial description of the website. It will give the player all of the information they need. The game modes section will show a list of the 
gamemodes available to the player and allow the player to select the gamemode of their choosing. It will also allow the player to change their search preferences and view what 
matches are available. The site is easy to navigate and match match the player with others seamlessly.

## Far Vision
We will take in game data along with player and user generated behavior profiles to match the player with the teammates that best suit their skill and behavior. 
The matchmaking system will enable the users find users from their matches and then add them as a friend. The player and thier newly found friends will be able to form groups.
These groups can then search for matches together and matchmake with other players that fit their skill level and behavior. The player will also be able to view their profile. 
This includes the skill level, behavior profile, and playstyle archetype. All of these together will reintroduce the human component to online teammates and improve the players
experience in online multiplayer.

## Rationale for Backlog Order
The first task that has the at most priority is selecting the frame work that we will use to build the web application in. We have chosen React. This tool allows us to create the
web app that we want to create based on the specification that is required of us. It also allows the web app to easily be integrated with an API of our choosing. Using API allows
us to use the tools that are already available in the Web.
The next step is deciding on the contents of the web app pages we are creating based on the specifications provided. These pages can range in different formats based on the Product owner needs and our developers choosing.
The aim of the web app is to find players across different games that will be listed on the web app and based on different filters that will be provided match players. The data is 
gone be extracted from the API of our choosing filtered and displayed for our users.
