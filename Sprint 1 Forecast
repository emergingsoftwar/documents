The forecast for the first sprint includes: 
* Build initail web application: 5 points
* Create home page and about us page: 3 points
* Create contact button: 2 points
* Create footor for each page: 2 points
* Provide game selection: 3 points

These inital tasks create the base for our application. It sets up the initail page the user will see and the first few pages the user will click on to understand the application. 
It is important to focus on creating a good framework for our application because we could run into other problems if we don't focus on this first and get ahead of ourselves. 
Being able to select the game is our first task because it how the matchmaking process will start.
