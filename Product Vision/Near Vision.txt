Near Vision: Our initial focus in our product is to have a functioning website with a start screen. Our product will have a home button, about section, settings page,and game modes section.
The home button will allow the player to return to the inital screen they were presented after the start screen. The about page will describe the team, the reasoning behind 
the website's creation, and give an intial description of the website. It will give the player all of the information they need. The game modes section will show a list of the 
gamemodes available to the player and allow the player to select the gamemode of their choosing. It will also allow the player to change their search preferences and view what 
matches are available. The site is easy to navigate and match match the player with others seamlessly.
