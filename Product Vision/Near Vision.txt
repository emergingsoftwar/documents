Our initial focus in our product is to have a functioning website with a start screen. Our product will have a home button, about section, settings page, and game modes section.
The home button will allow the player to return to the initial screen they were presented after the start screen. The about page will describe the team, the reasoning behind the website's creation and give an initial description of the website. It will give the player all the information they need. The game modes section will show a list of the game modes available to the player and allow the player to select the game mode of their choosing. It will also allow the player to change their search preferences and view what matches are available. The site is easy to navigate and match the player with others seamlessly.
