Near Vision: Our initial focus in our project is to have a functioning website with a start screen. Next a home button, about section, and game modes section will be constructed.
The home button will allow the player to return to the inital screen they were presented after the start screen. The about page will describe the team, the reasoning behind 
the website's creation, and give an intial description of the website. The game modes section will show a list of the gamemodes available to the player and allow the player
to select the gamemode of their choosing. It will also allow the player to change their search preferences and view what matches are available.
