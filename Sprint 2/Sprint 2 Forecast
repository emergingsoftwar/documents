The matchmaking is one of the core components of our application. We will spend the majority of the sprint focusing on this and
making sure everything works properly. Giving a list of players for the user to pick is also important because it is the base 
of make later parts of the application. An example of this is the profile viewer that will be completed toward the end of the sprint.
