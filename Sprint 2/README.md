# Sprint 2
## Story Point: Forecast and Rationale 
### The forecast for the second sprint includes: 
* Matchmaking process: 3 points<br/>
* Provide list of matched players for selection: 5 points<br/>
* Profile Viewer: 3 points<br/>
* CI/CD System: 2 points


The matchmaking is one of the core components of our application. We will spend the majority of the sprint focusing on this and making sure everything works properly. Giving a list of players for the user to pick is also important because it is the base of make later parts of the application. The profile viewer that will be completed during this sprint as well. The list of players will need to be working for this part of web app to work. It is imperative that this be completed first in the sprint.

## Sprint Retrospective
### What went well during the sprint?
* Building the match making pages and process
* Learning the CICD pipelines
* Story and Task Closures
* Technical team meetings and frequest touchbase meetings helped us achieve the sprint goals
### Is there anything that can be improved?
* Story Pointing
* Publising test results with coverage
* Raising the issues early
* Early analysis of Third Party APIs and frameworks
### How can we make those improvements?
* The conflicting styling and alignment issues could have been avoided by early analysis
* Mapping of properties whats required vs available from API could have been done early
* Tests results with coverage can be published to undestand the code coverage
* Team should consider the complexity of the features before estimating the stories. The filerting functionality in match making page needed lot of effort and took longer than expected.
