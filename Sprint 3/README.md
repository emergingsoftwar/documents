* Building the Add a Friend and Friends List functionality
* Automated CICD pipelines helped us with the build. unit tests and auto deployments
* Story and Task Closures has improved
* Rising the issues early helped us define the scope of some features
### Is there anything that can be improved?

* Understanding the capabilities of framework
* Gathering the requirements and functionality of a feature
### How can we make those improvements?
* Adding more unit test cases and end-to-end tests
* More brain storming and desgin sessions before implementing a feature functionality
* Technical meetings and Mob programming sessions can be extended to make design decisions.
* Design sessions will also loead to research more on the capabilities of framework
