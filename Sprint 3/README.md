# Sprint 3
## Story Point: Forecast and Rationale 
### The forecast for the Third sprint includes: 
* Contact Button on Header: 2 Story Points<br/>
* Create/Form Groups: 5 Story Points<br/>
* Add Friends: 3 Story Points<br/>
* Provide PDF option to download friends list: 2 Story Points

After the creation of the matchmaking feature the abilty to add friends is very important. The design of the friend adding feature will be created and implemented into
the program. It will be completed first in the sprint because of the effort needed to complete it and its importance to the product as a whole. While this is being done, the 
group forming design will be created and implemented as well. These two freatures make up the bulk of the remaining story points and will be focused on primarly. Lastly, 
our contanct button will be created and place on our website's header.

## Sprint Retrospective
### What went well during the sprint?
* Building the Add a Friend and Friends List functionality
* Automated CICD pipelines helped us with the build. unit tests and auto deployments
* Story and Task Closures has improved
* Rising the issues early helped us define the scope of some features
### Is there anything that can be improved?
* Scope Creep
* Unit testing i.e. no of test cases can be improved
* Understanding the capabilities of framework
* Gathering the requirements and functionality of a feature
### How can we make those improvements?
* Adding more unit test cases and end-to-end tests
* More brain storming and desgin sessions before implementing a feature functionality
* Technical meetings and Mob programming sessions can be extended to make design decisions.
* Design sessions will also loead to research more on the capabilities of framework
