What went well during the sprint?
    Building initial web applicaion
    Learning the new React framework
    Mob programming and technical team meetings helped us achieve the sprint goals

Is there anything that can be improved?
    Story Closures
    Burning hours
    Deployment
    Third party API usage

How can we make those improvements?
    The stories should be moved to "Done" status once all the tasks are completed
    Hours should be burned for each task every day
    Set up auto deployment using azure pipelines instead of manual deployment
    Team need to spend some more time to understand the third gaming api that we are using for this application
