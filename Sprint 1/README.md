# Sprint 1
## Story Point: Forecast and Rationale 
### The forecast for the first sprint includes: 
* Build initail web application: 5 points
* Create home page and about us page: 3 points
* Create footor for each page: 2 points
* Provide game selection: 3 points

These inital tasks create the base for our application. It sets up the initail page the user will see and the first few pages the user will click on to understand the application. It is important to focus on creating a good framework for our application because we could run into other problems if we don't focus on this first and get ahead of ourselves. Being able to select the game is our first task because it how the matchmaking process will start.

## Sprint Retrospective
### What went well during the sprint?
* Building initial web applicaion
* Learning the new React framework
* Mob programming and technical team meetings helped us achieve the sprint goals
### Is there anything that can be improved?
* Story Closures
* Burning hours
* Deployment
* Third party API usage
### How can we make those improvements?
* The stories should be moved to "Done" status once all the tasks are completed
* Hours should be burned for each task every day
* Set up auto deployment using azure pipelines instead of manual deployment
* Team need to spend some more time to understand the third gaming api that we are using for this application
